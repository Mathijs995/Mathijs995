### About Me

I’m passionate about empowering others through technology and digital skills. Since 2013, I’ve mentored aspiring data scientists and software developers and taught courses and workshops on web development, software engineering, and data analytics. Currently, I’m a Senior Data Scientist at [BCG X](https://www.bcg.com/x), helping clients leverage data science and advanced technologies to drive business performance. I specialize in building end-to-end solutions—from ideation to design to full-stack implementation. The most rewarding part of my work is seeing these solutions empowering users, being adopted and improved by client teams, and driving real-world impact.

In my free time, I contribute to open-source projects and enjoy reading about economics, artificial intelligence, human behavior, business, management, and entrepreneurship.
