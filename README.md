### About Me

Geek with a passion for building and coffee. Currently, I’m a Senior Data Scientist at [BCG X](https://www.bcg.com/x), helping clients harness data science and advanced technologies to drive business success. I specialize in building end-to-end solutions—from ideation to design to full-stack implementation (the more hats I wear, the better). I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams and seeing our solutions adopted & improved, and making a real-world impact.

In my free time, I focus on coffee, building apps, and learning about Tech, AI, human behavior, business, management, and entrepreneurship.
