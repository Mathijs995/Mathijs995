### About Me

I’m passionate about using technology to empower others. Since 2013, I’ve mentored aspiring data scientists and software developers and taught courses on web development, software engineering, and data analytics. Currently, I’m a Senior Data Scientist at [BCG X](https://www.bcg.com/x), helping clients harness data science and advanced technologies to drive business success. I specialize in building end-to-end solutions—from ideation to design to full-stack implementation (the more hats I wear, the better). I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams and seeing our solutions adopted, improved, and making a real-world impact.

In my free time, I contribute to open-source projects and read about economics, artificial intelligence, human behavior, business, management, and entrepreneurship.
